# Racing AI

Written in 2021, this project is my first attempt at writing an neural network from scratch. The unsupervised learning AI uses a genetic algorithm, and it favours cars that are able to move around the track faster. After enough generations, this leads to cars that race around the track.

Looking back at it now, I'll admit that the code quality is quite lousy, but I'm proud of what I've achieved.

> :warning: **NOTE:** I updated `requirements.txt` in July 2023, and Pyglet doesn't seem to be working very correctly anymore (e.g. the opening menu doesn't respond to keyboard input, the car sprites don't rotate). Perhaps trying an older version of Pyglet might help? Or maybe an older version of Python, if that doesn't work?

## Usage

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 racing.py
```
